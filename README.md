## ðŸš€ Jink Package Manager
**jpm** is a package manager designed for a old Linux distro i made from scratch!
You can use the code if you want to implement a package manager on your distro!

NOTE: This package manager work only with file, there is no way to connect to a server, if you want to do that, just implement that xD
NOTE: It can be bugged, and maybe the code is not very good :/

## Download JPM

To download the v1.0 version of jpm you need to go to the release named 'release' and download the zip file, and put the folder in your / directory
Then if you want to test to install a package you can go to the release named 'package-example' and download vim9.1.jpkg.

WARNING: You can have some issue if you try to install vim with jpm if you have already vim installed on your computer.
WARNING: You can have some bug, this code is adapted for a linux distro i made with only the kernel so :/
